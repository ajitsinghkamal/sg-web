						<div class="content-desc">
							<p>Worked as a Visualizer in Ad Agencies for few years along with freelancing in Design & Calligraphy, I am currently focusing
								on experimenting & exploring in advanced Typography, Hand Lettering and Calligraphy; parallelly working on Visual & Graphic
								Design assignments as well.
							</p>
							<p>Graduated from
								<strong>Rachana Sansad College of Applied Art and Craft</strong> in the year
								<strong>2014</strong>, today I am associated as a
								<strong>Freelance Typographer at Ogilvy & Mather, Mumbai & DDB Mudra Group, Mumbai.</strong> Having worked with Brands and Clients
								like
								<strong>Big Bazaar, ASK Wealth Management, DMA Awards, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., Bank of America, IndusInd Bank, Standard
									Chartered Bank Bayer, Cambridge University Press, VIP Industries Pvt. Ltd, Safforn Art Gallery,</strong> in the recent
								past, fortunately I also got an opportunity of collaborating with
								<strong>DRAFT FCB-ULKA</strong> to pitch for rebranding of “Let Girls Learn”, an initiative by
								<strong>Hon. Michelle Obama & Hon. Barack Obama.</strong> A dream came true when I won the competition organized by
								<strong>Govt. of India</strong> of designing a Logo for
								<strong>BRICS Summit 2016</strong> and was Honoured in the hands of External Affairs Minister of India,
								<strong>Smt. Sushma Swaraj</strong> for the same.
							</p>
							<p>My Inspiration isn’t one or two but a diversified group of Artists, Calligraphers, Typographers, Thinkers, Writers, Poets,
								Actors, Innovators, Creative Directors, to name a few. My Objective in life is to learn and practice all the Indian scripts
								and the languages followed by foreign languages. In a long run, looking forward to have my own Design Studio specializing
								in Typography, Lettering & Calligraphy, ultimately making people smile with whatever I do.

							<p>“Sudeep Gandhi, in our very first meeting impressed me with his strong desire and willingness to understand the purpose
								and not just the content of the assignment given to him. His eye for detail, during the meetings and in his work
								thereafter are truly commendable. His versatile personality (from calligraphy to designing to theatre to …) comes
								in very handy in working on a variety of subjects with a diverse clientele, my work being primarily designing educational
								material (prospectus, posters, banners, leaflets, online advertisements etc.) </p>
							<p>However, what strikes me most about him is his unbelievable humility in spite of all the achievements that he has
								up his sleeve at such a young age. Sudeep Gandhi is born for much greater things and I'm absolutely certain he will
								achieve them.”</p>
							<p>Prof. Subramaniam Naidu,</p>
							<p>Director, Nads Star Enablers </p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>“I was looking for creative expertise in digital space, when my sister introduced me to Sudeep. I was looking to create
								my first E-card. Sudeep and I spoke, exchanged ideas. I gave him a background brief of what I was looking for. We
								discussed his ideas and he make the E-card. It was incredible to see just how much of what I had expressed and wanted
								was captured by him. We went through a few iterations and finally my wonderful E-card was ready.</p>
							<p>Sudeep is extraordinarily talented. His disposition makes him naturally adept to understanding the requirements of
								Clients and to use that as a starting point to bring his creativity in the work. Over time, Sudeep has created such
								amazing work for me, the Firm I am a part of, my family and friends. The most admirable quality of Sudeep is his
								reliability. He can be relied on for the quality of work and meeting timelines. He is also extremely patient and
								has the ability to see and to make us see beyond of your fixed notions and ideas. I wish Sudeep the very best and
								pray that he continues to inspire people with his work.”</p>

							<p>“Sudeep Gandhi, one of the most versatile and creative person, gifted with immense talent that we have come across
								among the younger generation in the field of Calligraphy & Designing.</p>
							<p>His association with us ever since the inception of our 1st Magazine “Brahmabodhi” in 2015 for his remarkable work
								has continued till date. No matter what the subjects are, he has always given the most beautiful creative form with
								dipper depth and right understanding. </p>
							<p>Sudeep’s aesthetic sense is unique, his sensitive stroke and splash of colours leaves the ever-lasting impression
								on the mind of viewers. Gifted with un-parallel art, we are sure that he will carve distinct image on the global
								map of the creative world. We wish him with love to have grand success in all his future endeavour.”</p>
