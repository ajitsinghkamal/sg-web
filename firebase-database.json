The use of Expressive Typography had been made to convey the attributes in a way that the employees can connect with. The execution was minimal and corporate but it did create a good impact. The consistency in the use of the design elements throughout the office and along with typography created a visual language of its own and made every passerby look at it twice. ",

This conveys the movement towards future at a faster pace and denotes progress. Secondly, the semi-circle formed around it forms the letter ‘C’ in a rapid stroke. The bold, natural stroke portrays the raw, unconventional and spontaneous aspects of its nature. Also the Logo Symbol as a whole, looks like a ‘happy emoticon’ which is a perfect complement to the name - Catchy Motions.",

Their Italian roots and close proximity to the inspiring art that’s present in every fiber of the city of Italy, reflects brilliantly in our competitive range of products. Our vast area of expertise both in years and in marquee clients enables us to remain up-to- date with the evolving trends and often be the frontrunners in introducing and adapting to new technologies and developments in the world of paints.",
			"desc_note": "'RIEVERA' - is an Italian word for a coastline, sea coast or river bank coast. An icon in the form of ‘Waves’ has been used to convey this reference to the coast. The parent company is from Italy, which is famous as the City of Artists. Hence to bring forth the essence of this, a minimalistic form of a palette has been used. Here the palette not only corelates to our product but also portrays the variety and range we have at Rievera. The shades of Waves in the logo depicts our vast product range. The angle of the palette is aligned in a way that simultaneously also portrays an open inverted comma, suggesting our range has an opening but no end in sight. A palette is an object which is used to create numerous permutations and combinations of shades  and soon a totally new colour tone takes birth. This sums up the essence of the brand - Rievera. ",

It ultimately reflects the modern character of Thane, yet sustains a traditional touch. Secondly the typeface used in “THANE” is also a bilingual typeface complimenting the Primary Typeface.<br>Following the described colour scheme in the brief, the use of Aqua Blue, Leafy Green and Chrome Yellow has been made in such a manner as to create the perfect blend in the design. It also relates to basic colour principles – that by mixing of two primary colours “Yellow and Blue” we generate a secondary colour “Green”.",

But to make it more meaningful and conceptual, I have used adjectives by which the animals are best known for. The artworks has an essence of Arabic calligraphy but it is in English.
